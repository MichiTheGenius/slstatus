# slstatus
This is my fork of the suckless [slstatus](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/) tool. It is an application for the bar of dwm and adds nice functionality like showing the time, date, CPU usage, etc. 

## Usage
- clone the repo to your home directory
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MichiTheGenius/slstatus.git ~/
```
- cd into the slstatus directory and compile slstatus in order to use it 
```sh
cd slstatus
make
sudo make install
```
